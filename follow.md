Here's your options for receiving updates about new blog posts:

## Option 1: RSS

RSS is the classic way to follow any blog. It comes from a time before
aggregators like reddit and twitter stole the show, when people felt capable to
manage their own content feeds. We should use it again.

To follow over RSS give any RSS reader the following URL...

<a href="{{site.url}}/feed.xml">{{site.url}}/feed.xml</a>

...and posts from this blog will show up in your RSS feed as soon as they are
published. There are literally thousands of RSS readers out there. Here's some
recommendations:

* [Google Chrome Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp)

* [spaRSS](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.etuldan.sparss.floss/) is my
  preferred android RSS reader, but you'll need to install
  [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/) on your device to use it (a good thing to do
  anyway, imo).

* [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) is a good reader for
  iPhone/iPad/Mac devices, so I'm told. Their homepage description makes a much
  better sales pitch for RSS than I ever could.

## Option 2: Twitter

New posts are automatically published to [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{
site.twitter_username }}). Simply follow me there and pray the algorithm smiles
upon my tweets enough to show them to you! :pray: :pray: :pray:

## Option 3: Email?

I tried setting up an RSS-to-Email list thing on Mailchimp but it doesn't seem
to like my RSS feed. If anyone knows a better alternative please [email
me.](mailto:mediocregopher@gmail.com)
